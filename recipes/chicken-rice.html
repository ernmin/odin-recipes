        <h3>Chicken Rice</h3>
        The Hainanese chicken rice is a dish that consists of succulent poached white chicken cut into bite-size pieces and served on fragrant rice with some light soy sauce. The dish is topped with sprigs of coriander leaf and sesame oil, and accompanied by a garlic-chilli dip.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Thai fragrant long grain rice</li>
            <li>2Â½ cups water or just enough</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic, lightly smashed</li>
            <li>3 slices ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter or margarine</li>
            <li>50g chicken fat with skin</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt or to taste</li>
            <li>2 pandan or screwpine leaves, shredded and knotted</li>
            <li>1.2-1.5 kg chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 slices ginger</li>
            <li>2 stalks spring onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and clean the rice in several changes of water. Drain rice well in a colander.</li>
            <li>Melt butter or margarine in a deep pot. Add in oil and chicken fat. Cook on medium-low heat until chicken fat turns lightly browned and oil seeps out. Remove and discard the chicken fat.</li>
            <li>Add in rice, garlic and ginger. Stir well to mix. Pour in water and add chicken stock granules and pandan leaves. Cook until rice is dry and fluffy. Allow the rice to stand time before serving.</li>
            <li>Rub salt and sesame oil all over the chicken. Insert the ginger slices and spring onion into the cavity of the chicken. Place the chicken in a deep dish and steam for 15-20 minutes or until chicken is cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the dish and cut the chicken into serving pieces. Use the chicken stock that's left in the dish as gravy for the chopped chicken or add it to the chilli sauce when serving.</li>
            <li>The chicken rice can be shaped into small rounds the size of golf balls. These are like the famous Malacca chicken rice balls and are an alternative way of serving chicken rice, one which children would perhaps find enjoyable compared to eating rice straight from the plate.</li>
